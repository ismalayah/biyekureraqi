Author <a href=#>Jennifer Niven</a> wrote the script with <a href=#>Liz Hannah</a>, who previously co-wrote “<a href=#>The Post</a>” and last year’s criminally underappreciated “<a href=#>Long Shot</a>.” They’ve provided the characters with an authenticity to their connection, even within the often hyper-verbal nature of their dialogue and the adolescent instinct toward melodrama.</p><p>Fanning’s Violet is pretty and popular with a hunky boyfriend, and she comes from a comfortable family. Smith’s Theodore—or Finch, as he prefers to be called—is known around school as “The Freak” for his sometimes-erratic behavior, and while he has a warm and loving relationship with his older sister (<a href=#>Alexandra Shipp</a>), his parents are out of the picture. None of that matters, though, when they encounter each other at the film’s start. She’s standing on the ledge of a bridge, contemplating jumping; he sees her during his morning run and gently talks her down. And while their subsequent interactions in the high school hallways are awkward, neither of them can deny this significant moment they’ve shared.</p><p>Finch won’t let Violet move on, despite her efforts. So when their teacher gives the class an assignment before graduation to wander Indiana, seek out some of its significant locations and present a report on them, Finch chooses Violet as his partner—and we soon learn why she refuses to get in the car with him to go on these journeys. Violet’s older sister died in a car accident at the exact spot on the bridge where she pondered taking her own life, and by looks of the silent, stilted interactions she has with her parents (<a href=#>Luke Wilson</a> and Kelli O’Hara), healing has been hard. But Finch has his own troubles, as evidenced by the elaborate, color-coded sticky note system on his bedroom walls, reminding himself of things to be happy about and encouraging words. And the lengthy scar lining the right side of his torso, which we see when he undresses to go swimming in the lake, suggests deep physical and emotional trauma. So does his propensity for absenteeism as he takes off for weeks at a time, worrying his few friends who can’t find him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46ao6VlpJ2ybq7Rop6hrF2luaKvxKxkpqemnrJuvsSvoJ6vXWd9c3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1200612-breezango-swerve-overcome-imperiums-interference-win-wild-street-fight.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Breezango &amp;amp; Swerve Overcome Imperiums Interference, Win Wild Street Fight</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./welcome-to-new-york-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Welcome To New York</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-d-train-2015.html>The D Train movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elizabeth-devasto-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-577068-html.html>Elizabeth DeVasto Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juliana-aiden-martinez.html>Juliana Aiden Martinez movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./poppy-pattinson-biography-boyfriend-family-salary-net-worth-516098-html.html>Poppy Pattinson Biography: Boyfriend, Family, Salary &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eric-holcomb-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-472418-html.html>Eric Holcomb Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaVibe.
