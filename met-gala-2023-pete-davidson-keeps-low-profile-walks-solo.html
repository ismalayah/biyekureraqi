He layered the look with a long black jacket — which he <a href=#>finished off with a matching bucket hat and sunglasses</a>. The comedian flashed a smile at the cameras while posing with Everything Everywhere All at Once star<a href=#><strong> Michelle Yeoh</strong></a> on fashion’s biggest night.</p><p>The <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> alum originally&nbsp;<a href=#>made his Met Gala debut</a> in September 2021, wearing a suit dress designed by <strong>Thom Browne</strong> and jewels from Fred Leighton. The garnet necklace he wore was reportedly chosen in honor of his father, Scott Davidson, who died in 2001 while responding to the September 11 terrorist attack in New York City.</p><p>The King of Staten Island actor joked at the time that he thought his first Met Gala invitation was a joke, but when he realized it wasn’t he decided to go big or go home. “If you’re gonna wear a dress, what better way or place to do it than the Met, you know?” he quipped to GQ in September 2021. “I’m really excited and really stoked that they thought I could pull this off, which is hilarious.”</p><p>The following year, the comedian <a href=#>attended the soirée with then-girlfriend</a> <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, who made headlines in a vintage dress originally worn by <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a>. The Staten Island native later revealed that he first asked for Kardashian’s contact info when they crossed paths at <a href=#>the 2021 Met Gala</a>.</p><p>“Remember when I asked for your number at the last Met and you pretended that you couldn’t give it to me because you had gloves on?” Pete joked in a November 2022 episode of <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>, referencing the reality star’s <a href=#>full-body Balenciaga look</a>. “It was actually the nicest excuse ever. I knew it was an excuse, but I remember being in the car being like, ‘Wow, she knows how to, like, make someone feel really good about themselves.’ I thought that was really sweet.”</p><p>One month after interacting at the fashion event, the Skims cofounder, 42, and Pete met again when Kardashian made her SNL hosting debut in October 2021. The pair started dating shortly thereafter but called it quits in August 2022. Kardashian, for her part, <a href=#>stunned on Monday in a custom Schiaparelli ensemble</a> with real pearls outlining the look.</p><p>The Meet Cute actor later dated <a href=#><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></a>, who also attended this year’s gala <a href=#>in a nude-toned Tory Burch gown.</a> More recently, he’s been linked to <a href=#><strong>Chase Sui Wonders</strong></a>, whom he met in 2021 on the set of the movie Bodies Bodies Bodies.</p><p>“Pete and Chase <a href=#>had insane chemistry on set</a>,” an insider exclusively told Us in January, referring to their time filming the horror comedy, which hit theaters in 2022. “As well as when the cameras weren’t rolling.”</p><p>The source noted at the time that the pair were telling people “they’re friends,” but their pals believed they were “too close for that.”</p><p>Last month, <a href=#>Pete gushed over Wonders</a>, 26, at the premiere of his new Peacock series, Bupkis. “I mean, she’s the best,” he told Entertainment Tonight on Thursday, April 27. “She’s the best actress. She’s gonna crush. She’s got a lot of cool stuff going.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Selfish author briefly brought up her single status during a <a href=#>teaser for The Kardashians season 2</a> that dropped last week. “I don’t even know where we left off,” the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> alum joked during a confessional interview. When a producer informed her that she was “still in a relationship,” Kardashian replied, “I was? Damn.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for more photos of Pete at the Met Gala:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMnqtmn5Ghrm5%2Bj2tqZqiVqbJusMCvoJ2rn6N6rLHEqapmpJ%2BserG%2Bzp%2BgpZ1drK6tt9Jmqqikn2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pineco.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pineco (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./randy-orton-tattoos-interesting-facts-wwe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Interesting Facts Behind Randy Orton's Tattoos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-d-train-2015.html>The D Train movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elizabeth-devasto-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-577068-html.html>Elizabeth DeVasto Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juliana-aiden-martinez.html>Juliana Aiden Martinez movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./poppy-pattinson-biography-boyfriend-family-salary-net-worth-516098-html.html>Poppy Pattinson Biography: Boyfriend, Family, Salary &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eric-holcomb-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-472418-html.html>Eric Holcomb Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaVibe.
