The film was, for far too many viewers, an essential introduction to the holiday, despite its century-long (at least) history. Coco‘s story follows the young Miguel on his journey through the land of the dead, as he seeks out his grandfather’s blessing to pursue his passion for music. It features incredible voice acting from a lineup of talented stars, an emotional and touching story, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some of Pixar’s most memorable characters</a> of the last decade.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Easily among the most dynamic characters in Coco is Hector, a roguish man who Miguel meets early in the film. Hector has been dead for years, by the time the movie rolls around, and wants nothing more than to cross into the world of the living to see his daughter. The nature of his death is a big focus in the movie, particularly after his true identity is revealed.</p><h2 id=h-how-did-hector-die data-injectable=false>How did Hector die?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Hector_Coco.jpg><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Early in Coco,</a> the cause of Hector’s death is frequently joked about among his fellow deathly denizens. That’s because, as far as Hector realized at the time of his death, he was killed by some bad chorizo. Death by chorizo is certainly a unique way to go, but its not the true culprit behind Hector’s demise.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>See, Hector initially comes across as a bit of a rugged rapscallion — fast talking, charming, and funny, but a bit aimless. He also seems irresponsible, and admits that no one in his family ever puts up his picture on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ofrenda</a>. This prevents him from making the journey into the living world to see his loved ones.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>The reason behind their rebuff of a once-beloved family member? Because Hector disappeared one day, seemingly abandoning his family. That same family —&nbsp;one that he and Miguel share, by the way — has since turned its back on music, due to Hector’s apparent prioritization of his musical career over his family.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>In reality, Hector never meant to abandon his family. He did intend to go on the road with his musical partner, Ernesto de la Cruz, but soon changed his mind. When he attempted to abandon their partnership and return to his family — taking his iconic songs with him — de la Cruz didn’t react well. He poisoned Hector, in order to gain ownership over his songs, and eventually went on to become one of Mexico’s premier performers.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Hector died by poison, not bad chorizo, and at the hands of a man he once considered a brother. His death is a tragedy, particularly when the pain his family suffered is considered. His wife did just fine without him, of course — even establishing a tidy little empire — but she never moved on from the man she thought abandoned her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXZm2pXnHnpqtp6JisaqxjKKlZpufmLxw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-lil-uzi-vert-leaving-earth-in-2022-when-he-turns-27-his-girlfriend-2022-2-361439-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Lil Uzi Vert Leaving Earth In 2022 When He Turns 27?
