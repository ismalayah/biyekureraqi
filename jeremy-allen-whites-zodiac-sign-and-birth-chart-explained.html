The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gene Wilder lookalike</a>‘s taste in a partner might be just as diverse as he is. Following his divorce from Addison Timlin, many fans even wondered<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> whether he’s gay</a>. Yet his dating roster includes fellow celebrities such as Selena Gomez and Ashley Thomas, and he was recently spotted hitting the town with the lovely Rosalia. With these latest developments, it seems some of those questions may be put to rest. Except one — what does he look for in a special someone? Here is what his birth chart has to say.</p><h2 id=h-jeremy-allen-white-s-zodiac-sign data-injectable=false>Jeremy Allen White’s zodiac sign</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jeremy Allen White (@jeremyallenwhitefinally)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=609 data-current-count=909 data-injectable=true>Jeremy Allen White was born on February 17th, making him the air sign of Aquarius. Although he is right on the cusp, February 18th is the final day of Aquarius, with dreamy water sign Pisces following close behind. People born on the cusp of signs often hold strong qualities of both. Aquarius is represented by the symbol of the water bearer, which can be a little confusing, since Aquarius is actually an air sign. The sign is very logical and loves taking new ideas and concepts and carrying to them the rest of the world, such as a person bringing back water for the entire community, aka a water bearer.</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>Although Aquarius is a highly intelligent and logical sign, romantic relationships can be a bit of a struggle for them. They tend to shy away from confrontation, and are known for their avoidant tendencies. In relationships, they can ignore small problems, which unfortunately can turn them into large ones. While their sense of conflict avoidance can keep them out of unnecessary drama, part of their life’s work is learning when and how to approach a problem and when to let it be.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>Often they can compartmentalize their career and relationships a little too strongly, meaning they can dive into their work, leaving their partner feeling isolated or even abandoned. As an air sign, they tend to also be more comfortable in the world of thinking and logic, and emotions can be a bit of a mystery to them. Although with White being on the cusp of the water sign of Pisces, he might have a little more access to emotional depth than most Aquarius do.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jeremy Allen White’s birth chart</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jeremy Allen White (@jeremyallenwhitefinally)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>Jeremy Allen White’s moon sign, the sign of his emotions, is reportedly in Aries, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AstroCharts. </a>With his moon sign in the fiery ram of Aries, entrepreneurship and independence are probably second nature for him. Aquarius and Aries are two of the more independent signs of the zodiac, meaning they can have a tough time in relationships, and often value partners who are equally independent.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>Aquarius often pairs best with other air signs, such as Gemini and Libra, but can do well with fire signs too. They value their freedom, and their work often feels more like a life mission than a day job, meaning it can take a lot of their time and attention. They tend to struggle in partnerships with emotional water signs such as Cancer, which, ironically enough, is the sign his former partner, Addison Timlin.<br></p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>Rosalia, on the other hand, happens to be a fellow air sign of Libra, a sign Aquarius pairs quite well with. Both signs are creative and intelligent, oh, and did we mention that Libra just happens to be the sign of partnership? Could love be blossoming between these two compatible air signs?</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=false>Jeremy Allen White’s love life might end up being written in the stars. In fact, we are willing to bet if he works with his astrology in picking his next partner, he may be in for a perfect pairing. Perhaps this intelligent Aquarius on the cusp of dreamy Pisces may have finally found his match made in air sign heaven.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8meqZ6lqWKurbjEp2SwoJmpsrR52aibopmTYsCqs81mmKecXZe2s8DHZpqhmaKpeqbEz6WYoqaVmXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-jontron-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Does JonTron Make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1383824-rob-van-dam-build-a-relationship-with-vince-mcmahon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rob Van Dam Reflects On Being Told To Build A Relationship With Vince McMahon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-d-train-2015.html>The D Train movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elizabeth-devasto-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-577068-html.html>Elizabeth DeVasto Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juliana-aiden-martinez.html>Juliana Aiden Martinez movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./poppy-pattinson-biography-boyfriend-family-salary-net-worth-516098-html.html>Poppy Pattinson Biography: Boyfriend, Family, Salary &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eric-holcomb-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-472418-html.html>Eric Holcomb Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaVibe.
