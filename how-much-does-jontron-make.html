Internet users who’ve been traversing the web for more than a decade or so will remember the entertainment website well. It’s still around today, but doesn’t boast nearly the popularity it claimed in its heyday.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>One of the former contributors to this artsy flash-animation website is JonTron, an American comedian and content creator who has since turned to <strong>YouTube</strong>. On the immensely popular video-sharing website, Jontron⏤whose real name is Jonathan Aryan Jafari⏤has collected more than 6.65 million subscribers for his channel, titled the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JonTronShow</a>.” The channel has rocketed in popularity in recent years, as have several of his related channels, including “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JonTronLoL</a>,” which has a whopping 20.7 million subscribers.</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>JonTron’s videos, which typically see the creator digging into internet drama, sharing his comedic take on current events, or playing a variety of games, typically get view counts between 2 million and 15 million. In total, his videos⏤some of which have been around since his channel launched in 2010⏤have more than 1 billion views. Even his oldest uploads, most of which see him trying his hand at streaming games, have view counts in the low millions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/maxresdefault-28.jpg><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Over the years, JonTron has taken part in a number of lucrative career ventures. He has collaborated with some of YouTube’s biggest channels, including h3h3 productions and Did You Know Gaming. He started a Let’s Play series titled “Game Grumps” with animator Egoraptor, whose real name is Arin Joseph Hanson, and has provided voice-over work for several games, including “A Hat in Time” and “Yooka-Laylee.”</p><p data-characters=663 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>The 31-year-old YouTuber has transformed his talent for content creation into monetary returns. Thanks to the ad revenue his YouTube uploads earn, JonTron boasts a relatively high monthly income. According to estimations from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What’s Their Net Worth</a>, JonTron makes approximately $12,500 monthly from his YouTube earnings alone. Weekly, he makes nearly $3,000, which translates to around $150,000 annually. His income has generally trended upward over the last five years or so. Back in 2016, JonTron earned an estimated $153,500. Since then, he has built on those annual returns to make more than double that amount in 2020, when he earned right around $258,000.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>His consistent <strong>YouTube</strong> income has earned JonTron a net worth of around $2.2 million. His overall net worth may in fact be a bit higher than this, thanks to the multiple other avenues⏤including with collaborations and via Twitch⏤through which he earns money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZqGnp2K6tq%2FHZpuonaNit7C606ump2Wdlrimew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./skipping-leg-day-i-see-if-not-even-dwayne-johnson-is-safe-from-body-shamers-then-were-all-doomed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Skipping leg day I see: If Dwayne Johnson isnt even safe from body-shamers, then were al</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeremy-allen-whites-zodiac-sign-and-birth-chart-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeremy Allen Whites zodiac sign and birth chart explained</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-d-train-2015.html>The D Train movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elizabeth-devasto-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-577068-html.html>Elizabeth DeVasto Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juliana-aiden-martinez.html>Juliana Aiden Martinez movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./poppy-pattinson-biography-boyfriend-family-salary-net-worth-516098-html.html>Poppy Pattinson Biography: Boyfriend, Family, Salary &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eric-holcomb-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-472418-html.html>Eric Holcomb Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaVibe.
