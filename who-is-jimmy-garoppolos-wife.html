Originally from Illinois, Garoppolo played college football at Eastern Illinois University. He was drafted by the New England Patriots in 2014 and served as Tom Brady’s backup for several seasons, winning two Super Bowls with the team. In 2017, the Patriots traded Garoppolo to the San Francisco 49ers, where he became the starting quarterback. With the 49ers, Garoppolo helped lead the team to Super Bowl LIV in 2020, though they ultimately lost to the Kansas City Chiefs. Prior to the 2023 season, Garoppolo was traded from the 49ers to the Raiders.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=498 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>Garoppolo has focused on football as his top priority, helping lead his team records and contending playoffs. But while Garoppolo’s professional football career has seen much success, he has gone to great lengths to make sure his personal life remains private. However, after Travis Kelce was named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PEOPLE’s Sexiest Athlete of 2023</a>, fans of Garoppolo (and his perfect teeth) were a bit surprised. While Jimmy is not currently known to be dating anyone publicly, there have long been rumors.</p><h2 id=h-garoppolo-and-alexandra-king data-injectable=false>Garoppolo and Alexandra King?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Alexandra-King.webp><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=879 data-injectable=true>Between 2017 and 2018, Jimmy Garoppolo was rumored to be dating Instagram mode Alexandra King. They were photographed together on several occasions, including Valentine’s Day 2018, when King posted a photo of them together on Instagram referring to him as her “valentine.” The two of them were also spotted together on the rides at Disneyland and shopping together in the Bay Area after his transfer to the 49ers. Though they never publicly confirmed they were dating, it was speculated they were a couple during Garoppolo’s time with the New England Patriots.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>Alexandra King, the social media star and model is originally from Boston. She also attended the University of Massachusetts where she studied Arts and Design. Though she has once expressed the desire to model full-time, she also runs a YouTube channel with beauty and lifestyle content.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>Despite the rumors and photos linking King and Garoppolo, Garoppolo denied having a girlfriend in a 2018 interview for Bleacher. It appears their relationship, if it existed, ended sometime in 2018. Garoppolo has not been publicly connected to anyone since. He maintains a very private personal life separate from his football career.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Garoppolo and Kiara Mia?</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by 𝐊𝐢𝐚𝐫𝐚 𝐌𝐢𝐚 (@kiaramiairani)</a></p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>In July 2018, just one month after being seen with Alexandra King, Jimmy Garoppolo was photographed out with adult film star Kiara Mia, and a second, unidentified woman. This sparked rumors that the two were dating, though Garoppolo did not confirm anything. In response to the speculation, he stated that his life was “under a microscope,” but he tried not to be too public about his personal affairs.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Kiara Mia is an adult actress, model and entrepreneur living in Los Angeles. Born Deanne Marlene Munoz in 1976, she began working in adult entertainment in her mid-30s, garnering several industry award nominations. She has Latin heritage and is known for her work in adult films and modeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>After Garoppolo suffered an injury in 2018, Mia jokingly brushed off fans who blamed her for being “bad luck.” She noted she was flattered people thought she had that much influence over someone’s life. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She said to TMZ</a>: “I’m impressed that people look at me as a god…Like, only God has the power to, like, control someone’s journey in life.

In a manner that brings <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the romance between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift</a> to mind, Milan has been spotted attending San Francisco 49ers games wearing Garoppolo’s #10 jersey. Giuliana Milan also appears to be super friendly with wives of 49ers players, like George Kittle.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>Milan, who works in sports marketing, once posted an Instagram exchange with Claire Kittle, wife of 49ers tight end George Kittle. This fueled the relationship rumors with Garoppolo even further with some fans inferring that she was a wife just like Claire Kittle.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=false>However, as neither Garoppolo nor Giuliana have commented on their relationship status, it remains speculative. They may be dating, or it could simply be a coincidence that Giuliana wears Jimmy’s jersey number and attends his games and interacts with 49ers family members. Overall, Garoppolo continues to keep his personal life very private. Unless the two confirm a relationship themselves, the extent of their connection remains ambiguous to outside observers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmopmiurp5xpqpqKigpLmwv4ywoJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-christmas-with-the-kranks-2-coming-to-streaming-the-rumors-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Christmas with the Kranks 2 coming to streaming?
