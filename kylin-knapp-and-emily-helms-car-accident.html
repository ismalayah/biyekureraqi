Knapp of Washington, C.H, and Emily J. Helms of New Holland, were said to be in stable condition, but later, <strong>Emily died due to severe injuries.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Affect Of Accident</h2><p>The specialists on the subject said that <strong>the tiny collision was terrible.</strong> The reasons for the little accident are not entirely apparent.&nbsp;</p><p>The consequence of this incident is upsetting because Kylin Knapp is in critical condition, and Emily Helm has passed away in the Car accident.&nbsp;</p><p>Knapp and Helms were given medical attention and transported from the site by Fayette County EMS to Adena-Fayette Hospital before moving to a local trauma facility for more medical care.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Authorities Issued A Public Statement&nbsp;</h2><p>The police authorities released a statement where they summarised the details of the incident.</p><p>Sheriff Vernon Stanforth reported that Kylan C. Knapp, 18, of Washington Court House, was driving a 2002 Chevrolet 2500 pickup truck when he lost control of it at the intersection of Lewis Road while it was headed northeast on Bloomingburg- New Holland Road.&nbsp;</p><p>The car veered off the left side of the road and struck a tree, a landscape feature, and a stop sign before coming to rest in a house’s yard.</p><p>Knapp was trapped under the car and freed himself with the help of Washington Fire Department personnel.&nbsp;</p><p>Emily J. Helms, an 18-year-old passenger from New Holland, Ohio, was thought to have been thrown from the car during the collision.&nbsp;</p><p>The collision severely damaged the car, and it had to be hauled away. It was discovered that Knapp and Helms had both just left the high school’s Miami Trace Prom celebration.</p><p>According to reports, Stanforth said that the Knapp car and maybe another vehicle was driving erratically in the school parking lot before the collision.</p><p>Deputies working the prom event informed a nearby deputy of the hazardous operation.&nbsp;</p><p>The vehicle that was later identified as being driven by Knapp left the Miami Trace Fast School parking area at a high rate of speed while moving northeast on Bloomingburg-New Holland Road as the deputy entered the school’s parking lot.&nbsp;</p><p>The deputy drove up to the crash and provided treatment to the occupants until EMS arrived after turning around to leave the parking lot and trying to catch up with the car but losing sight.</p><p><strong>The Pickaway County Sheriff’s Office Traffic Crash Reconstruction Unit</strong> assists the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office Traffic Crash Reconstruction Unit in investigating the collision.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC32KWgp2Wbo66xvIyapZ1llaK2rcWMoZylpaNisKK%2BjJqanKGUmru1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-dandridge.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Laura Dandridge movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-hulu-remove-fear-the-walking-dead-where-to-stream-the-spin-off-series.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Hulu remove Fear the Walking Dead?
