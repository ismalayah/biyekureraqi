This included even Arn Anderson’s son, Brock Anderson, who was let go by AEW last year. Now, Arn Anderson has revealed what’s next for his son following his AEW departure.</p><p>Brock Anderson signed a deal with Tony Khan back in 2022 but was rarely used on AEW television. His most notable appearance was his squash match against Malakai Black last year.</p><p>As previously reported,&nbsp;<a href=#>Brock Anderson was removed from AEW’s roster page back in October last year</a>. This did not come as surprise for many either. Brock Anderson <a href=#>would then comment on his departure as well</a>.</p><p>While speaking on his&nbsp;<a href=#>ARN&nbsp;podcast</a>, Arn Anderson provided an update on how his son is doing after his exit. The Hall of Famer stated that he believes his son needs to accumulate more in-ring experience for better development. He sees frequent competition as essential, suggesting it may be an opportunity his son didn’t fully have toward the end of his run in AEW.</p><p>“He’s gonna have to make his own decisions on the options that he has.”</p><p>“I think he needs more seasoning. He needs, you know, with the pressures not on him. That it’s off. He needs to learn, you know some more of the mechanics, but basically, that’s not the issue.</p><p>“He could basically do anything mechanically and he’s got a good head for the business. He’s just got to get in there and pull some time.</p><p>“That’s all that’s missing and it’s the same thing that was missing with everybody that’s ever put on a pair of boots. You have to have time in to get better.”</p><p>“(That’s) not to say if somebody offered him something he couldn’t refuse. That’s going to be his call at the time.</p><p>Yes, you know, he needs to get as many reps as he can with as many different opponents as he can.”</p><p>Since departing from AEW in October, Brock Anderson has only participated in one match, which was a tag team match at WrestleCade SuperShow 2023 held in his native North Carolina. Only time will tell what the future holds for Brock Anderson.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of Brock Anderson’s AEW departure?
