However, a disturbing revelation about <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonah Hill</a></strong> and Sarah Brady proves otherwise.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>The pair – who made their relationship public in 2021 – called it quits a few months ago, but that didn’t stop Brady from making certain details about her past public knowledge. This happened when she termed Hill as “emotionally abusive” during their dating period, and provided evidence to substantiate her claim.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-between-sarah-brady-and-jonah-hill data-injectable=false><strong>What happened between Sarah Brady and Jonah Hill?</strong></h2><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>In a series of Instagram stories that Brady shared on July 7, she exposed the past conversations between her and Hill, which allegedly proves emotional manipulation by the latter. In the exchange of messages, Hill sets certain boundaries for Brady to follow if she wanted to continue their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-17.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-18.png><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Brady purportedly wasn’t allowed to wear a bathing suit, engage in close interaction with males, as well as be friends with women who are in “unstable places.” These are just a few of the rules, and as per Hill, trespassing them meant the end of their relationship. Through the snaps of their conversations shared by Brady, we can also see Hill barring her from pursuing modeling. Taking about the issue, she mentioned that even though she was disturbed, she complied with the terms and conditions at the time.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>However, her approach changed after she took to Instagram on Friday, the same date when she released she and Hill’s conversation, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">writing about </a>how the constant pressure of subjecting herself to the aforementioned “requests” affected her mental health and peace.</p><p>“It’s been a year of healing & growth with the help of loved ones and doctors to get back to living my life without guilt, shame and self-judgment for things as small as surfing in a swimsuit rather than a more conservative wetsuit. And I’m sure there’s still much more healing from this abuse ahead of me.</p><p>Sharing this publicly now because keeping it to myself was causing more damage to my mental health than sharing it could ever do.”</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>She added how her surfing videos bothered Hill, who asked her to stop posting, as well as take down the photos of her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“ass in a thong.”</a> Given the alleged amount of control of which Brady was on the receiving end, she warned young women from enduring such a behavior. “This is&nbsp;a warning to all girls. If your partner is talking to you like this, make an exit plan. Call me if you need an ear.”</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>The surf master – not unlike Hill – claimed to have had mental health issues in the past, but she reportedly was the passive party in the relationship setup. “I too struggle with mental health, but I do not use it to control [people] as he did to me,” is what she said about the degrading position which she claimed to have been subjected to.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=false>The messy relationship between Hill and Brady has undoubtedly attracted attention and while we don’t have a concrete reply from the former at this point, we will definitely keep our eyes peeled for further updates. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMnaCdZZqku6K0jKGgpaSjYrK5ecaiqaWeop6yr7CMrJirmZhir7Otw7JknJmcoXqptcxmmGalmai8qMXNoqqtZZ6Wv6S10qygrKxdlrmtscaaq6Knnqh6sLKMnqSorJmku6K4jJqZrquVYq6orcinqq1lmqS7orSMoaClpF2axbG4wKKlnpxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./corey-maggette-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Corey Maggette Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-starhawk-sylvester-stallones-guardians-of-the-galaxy-character-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Starhawk?
