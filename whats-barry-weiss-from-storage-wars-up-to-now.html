The A&E reality series quickly became a channel hit for its unique concept and the cast of ambitious bidders clashing, competing, and uncovering numerous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fascinating treasures </a>in every episode. Unfortunately, things took a turn around season four when some of the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> original cast members bid their farewell,</a> including the wealthy Barry Weiss and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the show’s antagonist, Dave Hester.</a></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=574 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>With so many cast members leaving, Weiss’ presence was one of the most definitive changes in the show, after we all got used to his constant show-off of opulence. Aside from his departure from the show, Weiss also took the front stage in headlines in 2019, after having a distressing motorcycle accident that left a physical dent in his life, with rumors running amok on social media with outlets <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing his passing</a>.

Despite his initial spin-off’s questionable success, Weiss remained a famous name among bidding enthusiasts. In 2015, another spin-off, Storage Wars: Barry Strikes Back, was introduced in an attempt to maintain the excitement he brought to the channel.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>After the 2019 accident, many people believed Weiss had actually passed away. He was left severely injured, however, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">contrary to popular belief</a>, the reality star managed to survive, but not without repercussions. With multiple shattered bones, internal traumas, and other damages, Weiss underwent numerous procedures to repair the harm.
