The audience votes on the Pokémon that looks the coolest, most beautiful, cutest, most clever, or toughest, depending on the category of the contest. Condition stats that are liked by the audience and the Pokémon's <a href=# title=Sheen>sheen</a> also beneficially influence the votes. To raise a Pokémon's condition, Coordinators prepare <a href=# title=Pokéblock>Pokéblocks</a> of specific colors and feed them to their Pokémon.

Additionally, a special introduction is shown for the Pokémon with the highest score in this round. If multiple contestants are tied for the highest score, each of them will get the special introduction.</p><p>Within the game itself, the audience score is based on the sum of the following:</p><ul><li>The full value of the condition in the contest's primary condition stat</li><li>50% of the value of the condition in each of the contest's secondary condition stats</li><li>50% of the value of the Pokémon's overall sheen, except that sheen is not tracked in Generation VI and is therefore not included in the formula there</li></ul><p>In Generation III, <a href=# title=Scarf>Scarves</a> held by the Pokémon raise the matching colored condition stat by 20 points, but not to more than 255.

The second round is the <a href=# title="Contest Battle">Battle Stage</a>, in which Coordinators compete in <a href=# title="Pokémon battle">Pokémon battles</a> while continuing to show off their Pokémon's style and skill. Each battle lasts five minutes and the object of the battle is to decrease the opponent's points. Coordinators lose points when their Pokémon are hit by an attack, when their Pokémon's attack fails, when the opponent's Pokémon performs a particularly appealing move, or when the opponent's Pokémon uses their Pokémon's attack to its own advantage. A battle can also end when one of the Pokémon is unable to battle, called <a href=# title=Fainting>Battle Off</a> by the judges. In this case, the Coordinator with the remaining Pokémon is declared the winner.</p><p>A Coordinator needs a <a href=# title="Contest Pass">Contest Pass</a> from a particular region to enter Pokémon Contests there.
