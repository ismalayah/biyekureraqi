She was previously arrested for DUI in 2007, in California. Her initial punishment was community service, but after the violation, she was sentenced to 30 days in jail.</p><p>She successfully completed her community service but was ordered to complete an alcohol treatment program after violating her parole. The reason for the violation was that she missed several sessions due to her busy schedule.</p><p>Shortly after being caught under the influence in March 2007, Khloe said in a confessional: “I just know I’m going to jail.” It comes after she was pulled over by police and failed a series of sobriety tests.</p><p>Khloe has always been open about spending time in jail, with the memorable moment caught on camera as sister <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Kardashian</a> took selfies during the car ride before dropping Khloe off in prison.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Remember when Khloe Kardashian went to jail in 2007. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2yUvFe8NkO</a></p>— PetiteAnge (@PetiteAnge_) <a href=#>February 5, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-time-behind-bars-was-cut-short>Her time behind bars was cut short</h2><p>Although Khloe was sentenced to 30 days in jail, it was cut short and she was released after less than three hours due to overcrowding in the prison. Jails often release non-violent offenders if they’re short on space, as per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>.</p><p>At the time of her release, her representatives let the public know she was willing to serve her sentence. The jail time came after Kris explained in a confessional that Khloé always “struggled with her grief and anger at this time of year.”</p><p>Fans often jokily comment on how Khloe talks about jail time as though she was in there for a lot more than three hours. The re-enacted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KUWTK</a> scene of a drunken Khloe often reminds viewers of Kris’ classic comment, when she said:</p><p>Kim, would you stop taking pictures?
